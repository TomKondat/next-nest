# Next Nest

## Description

Next Nest is the final project from our Elevation Fullstack Bootcamp. We collaborated as a team, using GitHub for code management and Trello for tracking tasks. The app is designed to simplify how agents connect with buyers and renters, allowing them to list, filter, and manage properties seamlessly.

## Key Features

Next Nest stands out with several key features. Agents are empowered with tools to create, edit, and manage their property listings effortlessly, while buyers can use advanced search filters to narrow down their options based on specific needs such as location and price. The favorites feature allows buyers to save properties theyâ€™re interested in, enabling easy access later. For security, Next Nest implements a robust JWT authentication system, providing safe login and registration functionality. And with a responsive, mobile-friendly design, the platform ensures that users can explore properties from any device with ease.
